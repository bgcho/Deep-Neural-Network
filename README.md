# Deep-Neural-Network

This code is to detect/recognize hand-written digits using Deep Neural Network framework. The network is trained using the MNIST dataset. This is a simplge code using sigmoid activation function and the network is initialized randomly.

1. load_mnist.py is to load the MNIST data. It loads the training/validation/test data.
2. DNN_sigmoid.py is to train the network.
